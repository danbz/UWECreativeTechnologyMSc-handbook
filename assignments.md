# Assignments and marking

## Assessment
We use a range of assessment tools throughout the course, such as coursework, portfolio presentations, academic written submissions, poster presentations and exams for individual modules. You will also complete a dissertation based on the final collaborative project.

#### Successful completion of your Masters degree
In order to be eligible for a Masters degree, you are required to pass 180 credits. The following section sets out how the differential outcome for the award is then calculated once you have achieved 180 credits.

The following method of calculation will apply to all Masters degree students who registered for the first time on or after the 1st September 2018 and to all students who registered before the 1st September 2018 but will be graduating in 2018/2019.

* **Merit** A merit will be awarded where a weighted average of at least 60% has been achieved across any combination of modules at level M totalling 120 credits.

* **Distinction** A distinction will be awarded where a weighted average of at least 70% has been achieved across any combination of modules at level M totalling 120 credits.

The calculation will use the weighted average of your best 120 credits at level M to determine your final outcome. If you wish to estimate this yourself, you can multiply the mark for each of your ‘best’ modules by its credit value (e.g. 15, 30, 45) and divide the overall total by 120.

Any outcome that you calculate is based solely on your selection of marks, and the University will not be bound by any calculation that you create.

The academic record system works with unrounded marks, but the marks you see on myUWE are rounded to the nearest whole number, so there may be a small difference between your estimate and that of the academic record system.

## Marking rubrics
The range of marking at Masters level is as follows, Note 50% is a pass, each individual assignment will guide you toward any specific marking criteria appropriate to the deliverable materials.

|  Mark | Status |Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| 90-100| Pass  |Excellent, publishable, world class work.|
| 80-89 | Pass | Excellent, meeting very high academic criteria, goes beyond brief requirements.|
| 70-79 | Pass | Very Good, meets brief and shows clear understanding with very good structure and creative flair.|
| 60-69 | Pass | Good, meets all the requirements of the brief.|
| 50-59 | Fail | Pass, only meets the most basic of the assessment specifications. |
| 40-49 | Fail | Marginal Fail |
| 30-39 | Fail | Clear Fail |
| 20-29 | Fail | Bad Fail |
|  0-19 | Fail | Bad Fail/ Un-markable |


 ## Resits
 If you need to resit a module, you will be assessed again for the entire component/s you have not passed, even if you passed some of the work at the first sit and even if you had a missed assessments or exceptional removal of marks application accepted. You do not need to pay for a resit. If you need to use a further attempt (retake), you will have to redo all assessments and pay for the whole module again. No marks can be carried over from one attempt to the next, even if a missed assessments or exceptional removal of marks application has been accepted.

If you have a resit, this is shown in your academic record using a code. For example:

* 1RA – This is your first attempt at the module and you need to resit component A
* 1RB – This is your first attempt at the module and you need to resit component B
* 1RALL – This is your first attempt at the module and you need to resit all components.

* If the code starts with a ‘2’, that means it is your second attempt at the module. A ‘3’ would mean your third attempt and so on.

 ## Guidance and advice

 UWE Bristol has developed an Assessment and Feedback Policy for all taught provision, including collaborative provision. The policy sets out the purpose of assessment and feedback, and lists a set of operational expectations supporting how assessment and feedback form a critical aspect of the learning process.

Along with the policy, we have developed the Assessment and Feedback Operational Guide which covers the cycle of assessment from design, through to marking, moderation, review and enhancement.

The guide can be used by students and staff to help understand the cycle of assessment, and to help staff understand the requirements and processes for assessment and feedback.

### Principles of the Assessment and Feedback Policy:
* Articulation of assessment both as part of the learning process and as the means by which academic staff form judgements about the extent to which learning outcomes are met.
* Ensure that students have parity of experience which underpins learning and progression.
### Principles of the Assessment and Feedback Operational Guide:
Outlines the key stages of assessment and recognises the journey from design conception, marking and moderation to enhancement/review.
Promotes and facilitates the sharing of good practice across the University through a common framework and terminology.
Alignment with the QAA Quality Code.
### When is the policy applicable?
The Assessment and Feedback Policy and Operational Guide are applicable in all circumstances to all taught provision including curriculum delivered by our collaborative partners.

## Plagiarism Advice (https://www1.uwe.ac.uk/students/studysupport/studyskills/readingandwriting/plagiarism.aspx)
The usual university strictures about plagiarism apply to this assignment. It is good practice in academic writing to reference correctly the work of others that you may draw upon for your own. Please help us to clearly distinguish your original efforts by so doing.
If you use code from other sites, the sources must be referenced in your Bibliography. If you use any other site(s) as a source of ideas for your site, you must reference the source. If you copy code and/or ideas from another student's work, or even if you are helped by another student, you must reference/acknowledge the source.
