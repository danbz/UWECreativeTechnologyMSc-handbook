# introduction

Almost everything we do in our daily lives employs creative technology in one way or another, whether this is film and music, print and broadcast or commerce and interactive entertainment. Our increasing inter-relationships with technology means there is a growing need for skilled and highly versatile creative technologists who are able to identify, design, build and implement systems and solutions that stretch the potential of ideas, software and programming.

The course will equip you to work at the cutting edge of technology-orientated creative practice and its associated industries, with the key analytic and creative skills needed to embrace new and as yet unimagined techniques and their uses. You will gain an enhanced understanding of practice, technology and people, along with the ability to select appropriate working methods and approaches in professional creative contexts. It is also a pathway to further academic study in the field or for those wishing to forge a career within international research.

## Building on your skills
The course offers an in-depth and critical approach. Practical learning will allow you to create, apply and evaluate technological solutions in different creative contexts, including programming, web technologies, digital audio, musical composition, physical computing and project development.

Through a number of large project modules you will have the opportunity to take what you have learnt from the broad range of specialisms covered from across the Creative Technologies and specialise in particular areas of interest – enabling you to develop a deeper understanding of various elements of the creative technology landscape with regard to your own practice. Audio, music, visual and physical.

The Masters degree is relevant for art, design, audio, music, technical, computing, engineering, science or mathematics graduates looking to advance their competence in the creative development and applications of technology. It is equally appropriate for creative practitioners across visual and audio domains with the relevant level of technical experience.

## Designed for the real world
Established links with national and international industry and some of Bristol’s most exciting cultural organisations give you the opportunity to gain real-world experience though collaborative projects and work placements.

To enhance your professional skills and experience, from day one you will start working on real projects and building your portfolio. By developing your skills as a broad-based, creative technologist, you will be ready to step into relevant roles across a diverse range of sectors, spanning arts practice, academia and research, multinational industry and entrepreneurial start ups.

The course is centred on the design and developmemt of interactive digital systems with a strongly exploratory, practical approach to learning. Covering a very wide range of current creative technology and digital media and digital audio and music techniques and concepts though practical projects. We mix assessment techniques with a research and enquiry approach with an emphasis on portfolio and presentations aimed at building skills suitable for professional practice.

You will learn a wide range of software tools and skills with a coding and development underpinning. You will use video, 2d, 3d, VR and audio and image editing software alongside learning coding practice using contemporary development environments. You will learn to code in a variety of environments including essential web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and also have exposure to Processing Environment in Java and P5.JS as well as the C++ OpenFrameworks toolkit. The depth to which students go, and their particular direction is something we will assist with as students find their interests and specialisation through semester two and three, into their major project in semester three.

## Study facilities
Throughout the course, you will have access to the department’s full range of modern facilities, including well-equipped electronics workshops, computer labs, audio studios and hardware construction studios. Based at the Frenchay Campus you will also find the new purpose built Students Union buildings, sports facilities and halls of residence.

## Entrepreneurial opportunities at UWE
UWE Bristol has a new £16m University Enterprise Zone on Frenchay Campus, with 3 specialist Creative Technology startup studios that provide physical incubator space and enterprise support for graduate start-up businesses
