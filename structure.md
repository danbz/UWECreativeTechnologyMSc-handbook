# Course struture and rationale

The full Masters course comprises 180 credits divided into three 60 credits stages: Postgraduate Certificate, Postgraduate Diploma, and Masters. Students work incrementally through the three stages and must pass all modules at each stage in order to progress to the next.
Over the course of one year, you will study the following compulsory modules:

Semester | Major Core module | Minor Core Module | Elective 
------------ | ------------- |------------ | -------------
one, Autumn | [Creative Technology Toolkit (30 Credit)](structure.md#creative-technologies-toolkit) |Research (15 Credit) | Elective one (15 Credit)
two, Spring | [Creative Technology Research and Practice (30 Credit)](structure.md#creative-technologies-research-and-practice) |Digital Connections (15 Credit) | Elective two (15 Credit)
three, Summer | Master Dissertation Project (60 Credit) ||

## Creative Technologies Toolkit
In this 30 Credit module you will learn to design and evaluate creative computing solutions to satisfy design specifications by integrating modern visual, audio and interactive software and hardware technologies.
Syllabus outline
You will be introduced to a number of technology and design related ideas, topics and techniques including:

Problem formulation, rapid software design, development prototyping methods for the creative technologies
Audio and visual processing and programming for creative applications
Interaction methods: graphical, tangible and gestural interaction, design and implementation
Physical computing including sensor electronics, units and properties
Machine learning for creative applications
HCI in context: editing/offline, performance and installation
Traditional HCI methods; standards, benefits and limitations
Interaction mechanisms and programming responses
Tailoring interfaces for specific creative technologies purposes
Digital manufacturing techniques including 3D design, laser cutting and 3D printing
Learning goals
On successful completion of this module students will be able to:

Create, select and apply software techniques, libraries, data structures, classes and algorithms appropriate for the development of creative technology applications
Design, develop, test and evaluate creative computing solutions to satisfy design specifications by integrating modern visual, audio and interactive software and hardware technologies.
Recall, discuss, and apply sonic, visual and general human-computer interaction theories and methods within a creative technologies context.
Employ digital manufacturing techniques to design, realise and evaluate prototypes.
Classify, contrast, employ and rate a range of tools and frameworks relevant to the lifecycle of a collaborative creative technologies project.
Assemble and present a portfolio of creative technology projects, demonstrating versatility across a range of platforms, devices, users and contexts.
Assessment
The assessment will be used to assess learners’ abilities to apply skills and embed theory within practice through the development and communication of creative technology systems. This will require students to assemble and submit a portfolio of diverse creative technologies systems. The demonstration will be used to establish learners’ knowledge and comprehension of the module content, delivered in taught sessions and reinforced through reading materials. Formative assessment will be provided as part of the practical sessions. Individual feedback will be provided on the assignment and demonstration. Assessment criteria will be supplied with the assignment and demonstration specification.

## Creative Technologies Research and Practice

In this 30 credit module we develop research questions and manage the life cycle of a creative technologies project that incorporates the design, implementation, deployment and evaluation of a system that addresses academic or industry stakeholder needs.
### Syllabus outline
We will cover a number of differing ideas and approaches and you will be introduced to the range of topics including;

* Epistemology and ontology and the philosophy of knowledge
* Designing and conducting a creative technologies research project: reviewing, evaluating and managing literature; identifying aims, objectives and milestones; project management; formulating research questions; ethics
* Stakeholder engagement including requirements analysis, contexts, proposals, intellectual property, milestones, progress meetings, deployment, documentation
* History of digital art and the creative technologies.
* Interdisciplinary collaboration.
* Generative systems and computer art and music.
* Research methods including: quantitative data analyses and statistical techniques; surveys and questionnaires; qualitative methods, interviews, discourse analysis and focus groups.
* Communication and dissemination: academic writing, peer review and public speaking.

### Learning goals
On successful completion of this module students will be able to:

* Identify, review and communicate research from a range of sources relevant to a specific research domain within the creative technologies.
* Manage the complete lifecycle of a creative technologies project that incorporates the design, implementation, deployment and evaluation of a system that addresses academic or industry stakeholder needs.
* Develop and investigate research questions by selecting and applying research methods appropriate to the creative technologies to generate key data and present robust results.
* Communicate research within the creative technologies in a written and verbal format at a level appropriate for presentation at nationally recognised research events.
### Assessment
The assignment will document the development of a single piece of creative technologies research and should be presented in the format and style of a research manuscript for a creative technologies conference or journal. This will involve demonstrating an ability to create and document an extended piece of work. The paper will also be presented along with a poster at a controlled poster presentation in the format found at academic conferences. Formative assessment and feedback will be provided as part of the practical sessions. Assessment criteria will be supplied with the assignment and presentation specification.

## Creative Technologies Research
In this 15 Credit module you will design and evaluate research strategies and assemble and present a portfolio of research in a theoretical and practical context
### Syllabus outline

* Problem formulation, design, development and planning for creative research
* Reading, writing and formulation strategies for creative applications and outputs.
* Epistemological and trans-disciplinary reasoning
* Qualitative and quantitative research and evaluation techniques
* Statistical analysis for creative applications
* Poster and presentation design and delivery
* Grant and application processes
* Qualitative and quantitative research
* Language, referencing, citation, formatting and submission for formal writing
### Learning goals
On successful completion of this module students will be able to:

* Identify key processes, methods, tools and practices associated with creative technologies research.
* Design, develop, test and evaluate research strategies in a theoretical and practical context.
* Recall, discuss, and apply theories and methods of conducting robust domain specific research.
* Assemble and present a portfolio of research with evidence of evaluation and tangible outputs. (A and B)
### Assessment
The presentation will be used to establish learners’ knowledge and comprehension of the module content delivered in lectures practical sessions and reinforced through reading materials. The assignment will be used to assess learners’ ability to comprehend an apply research methods in the creative technologies and the communication of such systems.
