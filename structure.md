# Course struture and rationale

## Learning and Teaching
The course is based on a mixed programme of theory and practice. This will be delivered through a combination of lectures, presentations, seminars, workshops, group work, supervision and placements.
As well as contact hours on campus, you will be encouraged to undertake independent learning through essential reading, case study preparation, and assignment work. Consultancy projects and guest lectures from industry specialists give you invaluable insights into the professional environment.

Throughout the course, each student will be supported by an individual supervisor. You will also have access to high-quality technical and specialist support, facilities, labs and studios.

In addition to developing practical skills, there is a strong emphasis on developing your professional and interpersonal skills, such as presentation, communication, planning, costing and teamwork.
For more details, see our glossary of teaching and learning terms.

## Study routes for the Creative Technology MSc
The MSc Creative Technology is currently available as a full time course.

### Full-time study
Full-time students study for 60 credits each term. Contact learning includes six classroom hours per week with additional technical workshops, tutorials and project progress meetings during the academic year. Additionally, you will be expected to pursue your own self-directed study. This will be related to both projects and assessment goals, and can be based around your chosen area of interest or expertise.

The full Masters course comprises 180 credits divided into three 60 credits stages: Postgraduate Certificate, Postgraduate Diploma, and Masters. Students work incrementally through the three stages and must pass all modules at each stage in order to progress to the next.
Over the course of one year, you will study the following compulsory modules:

## Creative Technology Dissertation (60 Credit Core module, semester 3)

In this major 60 Credit module you will work independently to plan and manage a complex creative technology research project over an extended period of time, and complete it by a given deadline.

### Syllabus outline
Students are expected to carry out an in-depth survey of relevant literature to identify a focus for their study that contributes to existing research in the field. The primary research will involve the development of a creative technologies system. The written dissertation should make clear how the primary research was designed and conducted. Discussion of the outcomes of primary research should be clearly related to existing literature. The body of the dissertation should be supplemented by a critical review of key aspects of the research and development processes.

Initially, students will develop a short proposal outlining the problem or opportunity they will be addressing, their proposed solution approach, the research methods they plan to use, and their overall plan. Then they will develop an in-depth proposal for their dissertation.

### Learning goals
On successful completion of this module students will be able to:

* Demonstrate advanced knowledge of a complex and specialised area of knowledge and skills appropriate to the creative technologies domain. (A2)
* Address an in-depth problem relevant to the creative technologies using arigorous approach involving a non-trivial technology system. (A1, A2)
* Demonstrate an understanding of current theoretical and methodological approaches to the development of a substantive creative technologies system.
* Conduct and write up academic research at a level appropriate to Masters credit.
* Synthesise and critically evaluate data from multiple sources.
* Evaluate the approach taken in undertaking primary and secondary research
* Explore and understand the issues of ethics, validity, trustworthiness and reliability in research
* Work independently to plan and manage a complex computing research project over an extended period of time, and complete it by a given deadline
* Summarise, organise and convey ideas and succinctly and coherently

### Assessment
The research proposal, dissertation report and associated materials will be evaluated in the assessment of the student. The assessment of the report will be both in terms of its content (e.g. whether appropriate and sufficient research has been carried out, whether the design meets its requirements), the expression of its content (e.g. whether it is well-structured, well written, makes appropriate use of diagrams, employs an appropriate citation system).
