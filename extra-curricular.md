## Placements

Placements give you the opportunity to hone your professional skills, gain industry knowledge and expand your network of contacts.
From day one, we encourage you to develop an online portfolio and apply your skills in industry. To support this, we run an online forum and jobs board with details of internships, summer placements and other opportunities with our established industry partners, including Disney Digital Division, LYFT, IBM, E3. CX Partners and Gravity Well.
As a result, many students do commercial work alongside their studies. These range from developing smartphone apps, recording, game and website development and social media. Those wishing to boost their skills can also take advantage of internships and collaborative projects. Several students in the Master program are creating projects in conjunction with CodeWest, a UWE enterprise studio, for external clients. They earn real wages and gain experience and valuable portfolio work while they study.

## International Partners

You also have the option to gain experience in the international field with one of our partner institutions overseas. We have relationship and in-principle agreements set up for placements or exchanges with The Studio for Electro Instrumental Music (STEIM) in Amsterdam, Netherlands; the School of Experience and Interaction Design at University of Siegen, Germany; the IT University of Copenhagen in Denmark; The Informatics institute at University of Amsterdam, and the Hong Kong Design Institute in China. These will usually last one or two weeks.

## Study facilities

Throughout the course, you will have access to the department’s full range of modern facilities, including well-equipped electronics workshops, computer labs, audio studios and hardware construction studios.
