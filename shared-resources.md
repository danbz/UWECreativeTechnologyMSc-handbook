## Shared tools and discussion, information spaces

### We use a variety of online resources you can access

#### Blackboard

\([http://uwe.ac.uk/blackboard](http://uwe.ac.uk/blackboard)\) is the formal repository for documentation for all courses and modules you will undertake at UWE. The Blackboard Virtual Learning Environment \(VLE\) will have a separate 'run' for the main course or award you study \(The Creative Technology MSc\) and each indvidual module you are enrolled in. In each Blackboard 'run' will be details of the module, learing outcomes, up to date course specification, master version of assignments, module staff contact details and any shared learing materials such as reading lists and slidesets. Many courses will also feature online submission of assignment work and dissemination of marks and feedback. This is also handed through Blackboard.

#### Reading Lists

\([http://readinglists.uwe.ac.uk](http://readinglists.uwe.ac.uk)\) You can access online reading lists of core/required reading and additional/recommended reading for each module through individual Blackboard runs, or directly online through the Talis Library system. You can also search for materials and information and references through UWE's library systems. \([https://www1.uwe.ac.uk/library/](https://www1.uwe.ac.uk/library/)\)

Use the wiki to find regularly updated links to interesting creative tech things online and read \(and add to\) a list of useful tools and resources for creative technology. We also use the wiki for project blogging, shared documentation and arrangign ad-hoc elements such as co-ordinating tutorial timetables.

### Resources at Frenchay Campus
The *Project Room* (2Q30) is a dynamic space designed to support individual and group project working, including four bookable booths with large screens for group work. It serves as a printing hub and home for binding machines and a laminator to help with presentation of portfolios, posters etc and is open 24/7 during term time.

The *Project Room Desk*, open 9am to 5pm on weekdays, sells a variety of FET course related consumables for model making and sketching and loans out multimedia equipment e.g. cameras, HD camcorders, tripods, sound recorders and headphones, to Faculty of Environment and Technology (FET) students only.

The *IT Service Desk* (2Q33) is the first point of contact for all staff and students of the Faculty requiring IT or AV support. The Desk is staffed by three full-time members of staff. They are chosen for their knowledge and experience of the Faculty’s computer systems and their customer service skills. They also receive training in the common problems, queries and requests encountered with the systems. If they are unable to provide immediate help with a query, they will refer it on to a more appropriate area of the IT support team.
